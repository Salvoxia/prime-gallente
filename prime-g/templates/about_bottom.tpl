<div class="block-header2">Kills &amp; Real kills</div>
'Kills' -    The count of all kills by an entity. <br />
'Real kills' - This is the count of recorded kills minus any pod, shuttle and noobship kills. <br />
 The 'Real kills' value is used throughout all award and statistic pages.<br />
<br />
<div class="block-header2">Kill points</div>
Administrator option.<br />
<br />
If enabled, every kill is assigned a point value. Based on the shiptype destroyed, and the number and types of ships involved in the kill, the number of points indicates the difficulty of the kill. As a result, a gank will get a lot less points awarded than a kill in a small engagement.<br />
<br />
<div class="block-header2">Efficiency</div>
Efficiency is calculated as the ratio of damage done in ISK of ship and modules versus the damage received in ISK. This comes down to <i>
damagedone / (damagedone + damagereceived ) * 100</i>.<br />
